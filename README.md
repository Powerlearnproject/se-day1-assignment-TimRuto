Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain software. It involves design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance. Its importances include efficiency and security of user data and information.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Understanding the complexity and the processes involved in software engineering such as development of programming languages.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement Analysis- to identify user specification
2. Design- Building
3. Implementation- Changing the design into a code that the computer can understand.
4. Testing- To check for bugs and defects.
5. Maintenance- To correct any defects.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfall method- Has linearity and testing is done at the end.
2. Agile method- Testing is done after every phase. It is more flexible since changes are made after very phase.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer- Coding and implementation of solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer- Testing software quality by designing and executiing test plans.
3. Project Manager- Overseeing the planning and execution and delivery of projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE facilitates easy and smooth software solutions by enabling coding, editing and debugging. An example is Virtual Studio (VS Code)
A Version Control System helps the developers to manage changes to the code. An example is Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges faced include; Time constraints, Limited infrastructure, Evolving software requirements. These challenges can be overcome by; implementing agile methodology, upscaling on required resources and being upto date with current trends in software engineering

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit- It ensures that each unit performs its own function, isolated from other units.
2. Integration- It enures that the different components or services work together as expected.
3. System- It ensures that the entire system as a whole and that it satisfies the functional requirements.
4. Acceptance- These tests ensure that repeated user interactions on the system are functioning properly.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is guiding AI models to give a desired output or answer. It gives the user more control during interaction with AI, and get more detailed responses.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Translate this language.
TRanslate the language and outline the basic information.
